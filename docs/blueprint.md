## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#756285) to suggest technology and acoustics without being cold.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F5F5F5) to provide a soft and clean interface.
- Accent color: A slightly darker and more saturated blue (#1F7371) to make the Play button stand out.
- Dark Mode: Implement a default dark mode with appropriate color inversions to maintain readability and contrast.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clean readability in the input field and static text.
- Center-aligned layout for focus on the tool's function.
- Simple fade-in animation when the simulated audio response appears.
