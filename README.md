# Phonotype
<!DOCTYPE html>


  <p><strong>A prototype for a language-agnostic, IPA-native text-to-speech (TTS) tool.</strong><br>
  The goal is to generate accurate speech from any valid IPA input—<strong>without being tied to any specific language or phoneme set</strong>.</p>

  <p>This project aims to help:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conlang creators</li>
    <li>Linguists and phoneticians</li>
    <li>Language learners</li>
    <li>Anyone working with nonstandard or cross-linguistic phonology</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>Most TTS tools force you to pick a language model, which limits you to that language’s phoneme inventory.<br>
  <strong>If your IPA string includes rare or non-native sounds, it often gets mispronounced or skipped entirely.</strong><br>
  This project is about fixing that.</p>

  <h2>What This Is</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A basic prototype for inputting IPA and visualizing speech output (no audio yet)</li>
    <li>Built using Firebase Studio (HTML/CSS/JS based)</li>
    <li>Future goal: implement true multilingual TTS support with natural coarticulation and feature-based phoneme blending</li>
  </ul>
